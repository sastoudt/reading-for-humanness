## Summary (one to two paragraphs)

A strange device called the Predictor has been going around that flashes a green light exactly one second before the user presses the button. Despite how hard someone can try to press the button before the light, it still flashes and one second elapses before the button is pressed. The Predictor has been known to make people believe that their choices and actions do not matter, leading them into a sort of waking coma.
