# Reading for Humanness

TBA: motivation for/philosophy of this project

Use this repository to:

- find readings that would accompany a data-related class. Help students thing outside of the box and prompt discussions about ethics/statistical thinking in new contexts by introducing readings beyond the textbook.
- help students practice their version control skills. They can submit issues and/or submit pull requests that make progress towards pre-existing issues.


How to contribute:

- If you have a piece or collection in mind, file an issue (see formatting [here](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/issues/1)). For now, we limit this to poetry/fiction. We will have more guidance for journalism [coming soon](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/issues/2). 
- Look at the [issues](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/issues) and start making the folders/files necessary to make progress towards them.
- Look at the [issues](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/issues) and read a piece (or many) that still need summary/tag information.
