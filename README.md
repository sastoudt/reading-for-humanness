# Reading for Humanness

### Fall 2025, Spring 2026 Dinner Seminar at Bucknell University
**Data Tales: Exploring Speculative Thinking as Statistical Thinking**

[Check out the preliminary reading list here](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/tree/main/dinner-seminar)


Speculative thinking is part of the discovery process, and it plays a big role in statistics and data science. Speculative thinking is also necessary for world building; some of the most engaging creative works come from a particularly compelling “what if” scenario.

In this dinner seminar, we will try to find connections between speculative thinking in creative writing and speculative thinking in the fields of statistics, data, and computing by discussing data use (and misuse) “in the wild” and creative works that engage with the ethics related to data-related themes. We will start by reading some speculative fiction short stories together and discussing how they relate to data-related themes. Then the seminar will become more of a choose-your-own adventure, with students choosing their own reading material each week, drawn from speculative fiction collections, essays, and journalistic articles that are related to the humanness behind data and computing. 

As a class, we will document some meta-data for each story (overall summary, major themes, any keywords that connect to data or computing-related themes) in an online, open-source repository. Beyond being an aggregate portfolio of the thinking and learning we will be doing together in this seminar, this repository can be used by others wanting to break the false dichotomy between analytical and creative pursuits in data work.

No experience with statistics, data, or computing is necessary, but a willingness to thoughtfully read short pieces each week is required. 


### Use this repository to:

- find readings that would accompany a data-related class. Help students thing outside of the box and prompt discussions about ethics/statistical thinking in new contexts by introducing readings beyond the textbook.
- help students practice their version control skills. They can submit issues and/or submit pull requests that make progress towards pre-existing issues.


### How to contribute:

- If you have a piece or collection in mind, file an issue (there are templates to create these issues)). For now, we limit this to poetry/fiction/zines/essays/journalism. It's okay if you aren't totally sure if it will have anything that could be used in the classroom. If it seems promising, it's worth a look.
- Look at the [issues](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/issues) and start making the folders/files necessary to make progress towards them.
- Look at the [issues](https://github.com/sastoudt/reading-for-humanness/issues) and read a piece (or many) that still need summary/tag information.
