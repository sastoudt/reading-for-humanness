# Reading for Humanness

TBA: motivation for/philosophy of this project

Use this repository to:

- find readings that would accompany a data-related class. Help students thing outside of the box and prompt discussions about ethics/statistical thinking in new contexts by introducing readings beyond the textbook.
- help students practice their version control skills. They can submit issues and/or submit pull requests that make progress towards pre-existing issues.
