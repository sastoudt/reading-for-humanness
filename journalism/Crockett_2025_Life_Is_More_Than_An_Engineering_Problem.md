## Summary (one to two paragraphs)

Julien Crockett speaks with Ted Chiang about the search for a perfect language, the state of AI, and the future direction of technology. While his pieces revolve around relevant science topics, Chaing says he is more motivated by philosophical questions. He notes that his thought experiments take place in fictional worlds to get his points across better. In the second half of the interview, he speaks against the existence of a perfect language and denounces AI usage.
